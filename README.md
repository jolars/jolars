### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the [Department of Statistics at Lund University](https://stat.lu.se/). My
research focuses on sparse generalized linear models, such as the lasso and SLOPE,
in particular algorithms with
which to optimize the performance of these models in high-dimensional settings.

Please check out my personal webpage at <https://larssonjohan.com/> where I occasionally blog
about my research and software that I'm working on.
